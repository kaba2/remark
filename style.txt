Styling
=======

[[Parent]]: understanding.txt

The styling of the pages generated by Remark is controlled
by two Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files. They are
named `remark.css` and `pygments.css`. The generated pages
assume that these CSS files are found from the `remark_files`
sub-directory of the output directory. In case these files
are not found from the target directory during page generation, 
default style-sheet files are copied there. The default CSS 
files can be found from the `remark_files` sub-directory of the 
Remark library. Changing the content of the CSS files (in the 
target directory) allows you to change the representation of the 
generated pages. The default `remark.css` file contains lots of 
comments to get you quickly started on modifying the style to your
liking. After you have modified and saved a CSS file, 
reload the page in your browser to see the changes.

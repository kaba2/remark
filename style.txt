Style
=====

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

The styling of the pages generated by Remark is controlled
by two Cascading Style Sheet (.css) files. They are
named _remark.css_ and _pygments.css_. The generated pages
assume that these .css files are found from the 'remark_files'
sub-directory of the output directory. In case these files
are not found from the target directory during page generation, 
default style-sheet files are copied there. The default .css 
files can be found from the remark_files sub-directory of the 
Remark library. Changing the content of the .css files (in the 
target directory) allows you to change the representation of the 
generated pages. The default remark.css file contains lots of 
comments to get you quickly started on modifying the style to your
liking. After you have modified and saved a .css file, 
reload the page in your browser to see the changes.

Style
=====

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

The styling of the pages generated by Remark is controlled
by two Cascading Style Sheet (.css) files. They are
named _global.css_ and _pygments.css_ and can be found
from the 'remark_files' directory of the Remark library.
These files are copied to the 'remark_files' directory 
of the target directory if they don't exist there already.
Changing the content of these files (in the target directory)
allows you to change the representation of the generated
pages.

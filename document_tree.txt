Implicit parent document
------------------------

If a document with the RemarkPage type does not specify a parent, 
it is assigned the orphan node as the parent. If some other type of document
does not specify a parent, Remark gives the file an implicitly-defined 
parent. The logic for this goes as follows:

 * In the same directory, search for the longest prefix file (excluding the 
 file itself). Give documents with RemarkPage type priority over other 
 documents. Only consider those files which have a parent document. If there 
 are multiple candidate files, pick one arbitrarily (Remark reports a warning 
 about the ambiguity). 
 
 * If a document with the RemarkPage type is found, assign it as a parent. 

 * Otherwise, if some other type of document is found, assign its parent 
 as a parent. 

 * Otherwise, assign the orphan node as a parent.

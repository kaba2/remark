A _document-tag_, or a tag, is a document-specific key-text pair, where 
the text can be queried and modified by its key. In contrast to 
[variables][Variables], tags do not have a scope, and they persist for
the whole execution of Remark. This allows to embed meta-data into
documents, which can then be used by the [macros][Macro].

Setting a tag
-------------

A document-tag can be set by the `set_tag` command, and retrieved by
the `tag` command. 

[[Example]]:
	[[set_tag author]]: 
		John Doe 
		Jane Doe
	[[tag author]]

Predefined tags
---------------

Remark predefines the following tags for each document.
They can be freely changed. However, they are provided 
useful initial values by the tag parsers before starting 
the conversion. The predefined tags are:

description
:	Contains the document's description. This is what is
	used as a description of the document when generating
	the SourceChildren macro.

link_description
:	Contains a description of the document most suitable
	for a link-name, with possible escaping for the Markdown
	meta-characters. This is defined by the document-type
	of the document. For most of the document-types this
	is the same as the description, however, for code files
	the link-description is the relative file-name.

detail
:	A more detailed description of the document.
	Empty by default.

author
:	The author(s) of the document. Empty by default.

file_name
:	The file-name of the document, without preceding directories.

relative_name
:	The path to the document, relative to the root input directory.

relative_directory
:	The directory containing the document, relative to the root 
	input directory.

extension
:	The file-extension of the input-document, in lower-case.

html_head
:	The contents of this tag will be pasted to the head-section
	of the html-code. Empty by default.

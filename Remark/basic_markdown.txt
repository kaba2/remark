Basic Markdown syntax
=====================

[[Parent]]: remark_syntax.txt

Here we provide a brief tutorial to the Markdown syntax
which is the basis on which Remark syntax has been built.
We provide an external link to complete documentation below. 

Markdown syntax
---------------

### Normal text

Normal text is generated simply by writing some.
Note that in Markdown new-lines do not start new lines
in the output. That needs an empty line.  

	Once upon a time there was an apple-worm...
	It was a very green apple-worm.
	
	Its home was built into a red apple. 

This produces:

Once upon a time there was an apple-worm...
It was a very green apple-worm.
	
Its home was built into a red apple. 

### Emphasized text

Emphasis can be added by using surrounding 
underlines:

	It was a _very_ green apple-worm.
	
	It was a __very__ green apple-worm.

	It was a ___very___ green apple-worm.
	
This produces:	

It was a _very_ green apple-worm.

It was a __very__ green apple-worm.

It was a ___very___ green apple-worm.

### Headings

The headings corresponding to html heading levels 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, are denoted as follows:

	Remark syntax
	=============
	
	Markdown syntax
	---------------
	
	### Headings

It would confusing to show here what these produce.
Instead, look at the corresponding headings on this page as 
examples of these headings.

### Verbatim content

Verbatim content can be written by indenting
the text. For example, this:

		Indented text.

produces this:

	Indented text.

The verbatim content is what we are using on this
page to demonstrate the syntax such that it isn't
interpreted as Remark code.   

### Links

Links are created as follows:

	[Remark syntax][1]
	
	[1]: remark_syntax.htm

Here we have mimicked the way literature is cited
in scientific publications. However, instead of '1' there
could be an arbitrary link name. The previous
produces:

[Remark syntax][Remark_Syntax]

[Remark_Syntax]: remark_syntax.htm

While the Markdown linking mechanism is fine
(and required) for external links, you will want 
to use the Remark linking mechanism for links internal
to the documentation. This is because it is
able to automatically fetch the description 
of the target documentation for link naming,
helping to keep documentation in sync. 
For example:

	[[Link]]: remark_syntax.txt  

produces:

[[Link]]: remark_syntax.txt

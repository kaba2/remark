    # You would hope that this fixed the long-path problems with

    # the CreateDirectoryW function of the Windows API does not 
    # support long-paths even by the \\?\-prefix, contrary to its 
    # documentation. So why we bother here? The reason is that oddly 
    # this trick works to support slightly longer paths with network-
    # mapped drives, which use some kind of path-compression to 
    # artifically produce longer path-names (but the compressed path 
    # also needs to be <= 259 characters). In particular, this 
    # situation comes by when the mapped-drive is a Linux file 
    # system, and contains paths longer than 259 characters.

    # It is essential that the \\?\ is only prefixed
    # for paths longer than 259 characters. The reason is related to
    # Python's handling of directories, e.g. in listdir implemented
    # in posixmodule.c, which uses a / as a separator to append a
    # /*.* path-suffix. The \\?\ has the effect, in Windows API, of
    # disabling any string-processing for the path, including the
    # replacement of / with \. Therefore using the \\?\-prefix for
    # shorter paths leads to invalid path-names. But why then
    # is the \\?\-prefix ok with paths longer than 259 characters?
    # I have no idea, but in our tests, the / suddenly becomes 
    # acceptable as a separator after this breakpoint.

    # To be consistent with Python, you might be thinking of using
    # the //?/-prefix instead. This has the effect of not disabling
    # the string-processing in Windows API, and the result is that
    # / are converted to \, leading to the \\?\-prefix, and also
    # avoiding the invalid path-names. However, for some unimaginable 
    # reasons, this is not equivalent to the \\?\-prefix, and does 
    # not work to support those long path-names in network-mapped

Verbatim stuff and macro parameters
-----------------------------------

The verbatim content is denoted by indentation.
However, the parameter of a macro is also denoted by
indentation. This becomes a problem when one would like
to write verbatim content directly after a macro.

 * Solution candidate 1: Add a Comment macro which simply
 eats the parameter which is passed to it. A comment
 can be used to mark the end of the preceding macro.
 Commenting is also useful by itself since Markdown has
 no way to do commenting.

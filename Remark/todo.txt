AsciiMathML can not be scoped
-----------------------------

For example, in Python code there might be an
empty string denoted by two subsequent '.
This will be erased from the output because
AsciiMathML interprets this as a start of 
a mathematical expression.
Unfortunately I am not aware of any ways to
scope the AsciiMathML to not consider all
places.

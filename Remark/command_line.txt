Command-line
============

[[Parent]]: user_documentation.txt

This section contains information on running Remark from the command-line.
Remark also contains an inbuilt help which can be invoked by running Remark
from the command-line without any arguments.

Options
-------

The command-line options control the way Remark operates. They are
as follows:

-l or --lines
:	set maximum number of lines for a tag-parser to scan a file 
	for tags (default 100)

-v or --verbose
:	print additional progress information

-s or --strict
:	treat warnings as errors

-r or --regenerate
:	regenerate all files

-d or --disable
:	disable a specific warning (e.g. -dinvalid-input)

-m or --max-file-size
:	set maximum file size to load (default 262144 bytes)

Warnings
--------

Remark generates various warnings that help in ensuring that no 
document is accidentally left off linked, that every document
has a description, and that links are specified in a way that 
promotes robustness. These warnings can be disabled one by one 
by the -d option. Warnings which are specific to a given macro 
are listed in the documentation of that macro. The general purpose
warnings are:

invalid-input
:	This warning is generated when facing input that is ill-formed, 
	for example, when a macro gets too many or too few parameters.
	To fix this, replace the ill-formed input with well-formed input.

ambiguous-input
:	This warning is generated when facing input that is well-formed,
	but ambiguous, for example, when giving multiple descriptions
	for a given document. To fix this, remove some input to	make 
	the choice unambiguous.

undefined-tag
:	This warning is generated when trying to refer to a tag which
	has not yet been defined. To fix this, either remove the reference or
	add a definition for the tag.

undefined-variable
:	This warning is generated when trying to refer to a variable which
	has not yet been defined. To fix this, either remove the reference 
	or add a definition for the variable.

redundant-path
:	This warning is generated when specifying a path in a longer form 
	than is necessary for the file-searching algorithm to unambiguously
	find the document. To fix this, remove the extraneous context from 
	the given path.

ambiguous-parent
:	This warning is generated when there are multiple documents matching
	a given parent-specification in the document-tree. To fix this, introduce 
	more context into the parent path to disambiguate the correct document 
	in the document-tree.

missing-parent
:	This warning is generated when the specified parent document can not 
	be found from the document-tree. To fix this, change the parent-
	specification to refer to an existing document in the document-tree.

unspecified-parent
:	This warning is generated when the parent document has not been
	specified for a RemarkPage document. To fix this, specify the 
	parent document.

missing-document
:	This warning is generated when a document can not be found from the
	document-tree based on the given path, for example, when specifying 
	images on an image gallery. To fix this, change the path to refer to 
	an existing document in the document-tree.

ambiguous-document
:	This warning is generated when a given path matches multiple documents
	in the document-tree. To fix this, introduce more context to the path to 
	disambiguate the correct document in the document-tree.

Incremental builds
==================

[[Parent]]: understanding.txt

This section specifies the regeneration rules which are used to decide 
whether a given document needs to be regenerated or not. This allows for
incremental documentation builds.

Regeneration rules
------------------

In the following, 

 * documents are denoted by labeled circles,
 * changed documents are denoted by a double lining, 
 * links are denoted by arrows,
 * removal is denoted by a red cross,
 * creation is denoted by a dashed lining, and
 * either a document or the abscence of a document is denoted by a 
 circled question mark.

### Document has been created

When a document A has just been created, it is generated.

[[Gallery]]:
	incremental-add-a.svg
	- Document has been created.

### Document has been modified

When a document A has been modified, its contents may 
have changed as well. In this case document A is 
regenerated.

[[Gallery]]:
	incremental-change-a.svg
	- Document is a file and has been modified.

### Linked-to document has been modified

When a document B is modified, its description may have
changed as well, thus affecting the linking document A.
In this case document A is regenerated.

[[Gallery]]:
	incremental-change-b.svg
	- A linked-to document has been modified.

### Link changes due to a newly-created document

When a document C is created, it may become a 
[better match][FileSearch] for a link from document A 
(e.g. closer to A in the document-tree than B). In this 
case document A is regenerated.

[[Gallery]]:
	incremental-add-c.svg
	- Link changes due to a newly-created document.

### Link changes due to removal of a document

When a document B is removed, a link from document A to 
document B either associates to a new document, if one 
can be found, or is left dangling. In this case document 
A is regenerated.

[[Gallery]]:
	incremental-remove-b.svg
	- Link changes due to removal of a document.

### Link is implicitly created to a newly-created document

When a document B is created, the document A might already 
link to document B implicitly (e.g. because B is in the set
of documents linked to by the [DocumentTree][DocumentTreeMacro] 
macro). In this case document A is regenerated.

	incremental-add-b-and-link.svg
	- Link is implicitly created to a newly-created document.

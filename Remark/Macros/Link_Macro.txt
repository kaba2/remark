Link macro
==========

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Generates links to documents in the
documentation tree. The labels for the links are set
to the descriptions of the target documents. 

### Output type

Remark

### Parameters

A list of target document paths for which the links are to be generated.
If a relative path is given, the file is linked to if it exists at the 
specified location. Otherwise, if only a filename is given, a search 
algorithm tries to find the document via implicit rules. This algorithm 
is detailed below.      

Normally you should use the form where you only specify the 
filename rather than a relative path. This is because most 
of the time the search algorithm does the right thing, and 
this also makes your pages robust against changes in the 
directory structure.  

### Variables

None.

### Details

The search algorithm for the case when
only a filename is given is as follows:

 1. Search from the current directory.
 
 3. If not found, search from the parent directories up until 
 to the document tree root.
 
 4. If not found, search across all documents in the
 document tree. In case there are multiple documents
 with the given filename, pick one arbitrarily and
 report a warning of the ambiguity.
 
Example
-------

This
	
	[[Link]]: 
		macros.txt
		remark_syntax.txt
		../../remark_syntax.txt
	
produces this:

[[Link]]: 
	macros.txt
	remark_syntax.txt
	../../remark_syntax.txt

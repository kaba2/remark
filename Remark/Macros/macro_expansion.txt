Macro expansion
===============

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Macro expansion refers to the process of taking a
macro invocation and replacing it with the output
of the macro. In Remark, this process can be carried
out in different ways depending on the need. 
Nevertheless, the following rule always holds:

_No macro expansions are done for verbatim content
(i.e. indented text)._

Controlling expansion
---------------------

In a macro invocation the user has explicit control 
over

 1. whether the macros in the parameter should be 
 recursively expanded before invoking the macro.
 
 2. whether the output of the macro expansion should
 be recursively expanded. 

These behaviors can be set by using a pair of signs
(+ or -) before the name of the macro. In this notation
+ means _yes_ and - means _no_. The first sign refers
to the expansion of the output, while the second sign 
refers to the expansion of the parameter. For example,
the following invocation of the Verbatim macro 
explicitly disables the expansion of the output and 
enables the expansion of the parameter. 
	
	[[-+Verbatim]]: [[tag description]] 

The example above produces:

[[-+Verbatim]]: [[tag description]]

If only one sign is given, then that sign is assumed
for both expansions, i.e. - = -- and + = ++.

### Default behaviors

If the expansion signs are not given, then
the expansions assume default behaviors. 
The default behavior for parameter expansion
is not to do it. The default behavior 
for output expansion is determined by the invoked 
macro.

Placement of macros
-------------------

The macros can be placed freely as shown in the following
example:
	
	[[set b: Nom]]Nom[[b]] [[b]]Nom[[b]] Nom[[b]]

[[set b: Nom]]Nom[[b]] [[b]]Nom[[b]] Nom[[b]]

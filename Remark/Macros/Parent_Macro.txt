Parent macro
============

[[Parent]]: available_macros.txt

The Parent macro generates a link to the parent document labeled
with its description. The Parent macro has a double role in Remark. 
As a macro it does not use its parameter in anyway. However, as a tag 
it is used to deduce the parent-child relations between documents: here 
the parameter is essential.

[[Parent]]: remark_syntax.txt

Macros are functions that map input text in some syntax to output 
text in Remark syntax. The functionalities of macros are implemented 
as Python classes. During its action, a macro has access to the whole
functionality offered by Remark. Most importantly macros
have access to the documentation tree. This way macros
are able to produce the correct descriptions and link
targets which have been deduced from the Remark source files.

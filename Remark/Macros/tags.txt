Document tags
=============

[[Parent]]: macro.txt

A _document tag_, or a tag, is a document-specific key-text pair, where 
the text can be queried and modified by its key. In contrast to 
[variables][Variables], tags do not have scope, and they persist for
the whole execution of Remark. This allows to embed meta-data into
documents, which can then be used by the [macros][Macro].

Setting a tag
-------------

A document tag can be set by the `set_tag` command, and retrieved by
the `tag` command. For example, the following

[[Verbatim]]:
	[[set_tag author]]: 
		John Doe 
		Jane Doe

	[[tag author]]

produces

[[tag author]]

[[set_tag author]]: 
	John Doe
	Jane Doe

[[tag author]]

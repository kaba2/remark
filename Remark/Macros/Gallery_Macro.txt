Gallery macro
=============

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Generates an image gallery. Thumbnails are automatically generated for 
_pixel-based_ images with filename extensions .bmp, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .pcx, 
.png, .pbm, .pgm, .ppm, .tga, .tif, and .tiff. Other image-formats,
such as the vector-based .svg or .pdf, are passed on as they are.

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

A list of the following form:

	image1.png
	- Caption for the first image.
	image2.jpg
	- Caption for the second image.
	image3.bmp
	image4.tiff
	image5.svg
	...

Specification of captions is not required.

### Variables

thumbnail_max_width 
: 	A maximum for the width of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

thumbnail_max_height
: 	A maximum for the height of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

The pixel-count defines the resolution of the thumbnail image
for the pixel-based images; if the number of pixels is too low 
compared to the presentation size (defined by the CSS), the 
thumbnail image will look blurry. Naturally, vector-based
images, such as svg, do not need separate thumbnails and are
unaffected by these variables.

To set the maximum allowed presentation width and height for
the image thumbnails, modify the `max-width` and `max-height`
properties of the `.highslide img` selector in `highslide.css`.
The default for these are 45% and 20% (of the containing element), 
respectively.

Example
-------

This

	[[Gallery]]:
		hsv.png
		- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation). 
		../../images/hsv.png
		lookaheads.svg
		- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing
	
produces this:

[[Gallery]]:
	hsv.png
	- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation). 
	../../images/hsv.png
	lookaheads.svg
	- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing

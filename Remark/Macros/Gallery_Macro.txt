Gallery macro
=============

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Generates an image gallery. Thumbnails are automatically generated for 
_pixel-based_ images with filename extensions .bmp, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .pcx, 
.png, .pbm, .pgm, .ppm, .tga, .tif, and .tiff. Other image-formats,
such as the vector-based .svg, are passed on as they are. While Remark will
pass many image formats into the html code, note that [well-supported 
image-formats][ImageFormats] in browsers currently include 
only PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG.

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

A list of the following form:

	image1.png
	- Caption for the first image.
	image2.jpg
	- Caption for the second image.
	image4.gif
	image5.svg
	...

Specification of captions is not required.

### Variables

thumbnail_max_width 
: 	A maximum for the width of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

thumbnail_max_height
: 	A maximum for the height of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

The pixel-count defines the resolution of the thumbnail image
for the pixel-based images; if the number of pixels is too low 
compared to the presentation size (defined by the CSS), the 
thumbnail image will look blurry. Naturally, vector-based
images, such as svg, do not need separate thumbnails and are
unaffected by these variables.

### Width and height of thumbnails

To set the maximum allowed presentation width and height for
the image thumbnails, modify the `max-width` and `max-height`
properties of the `.highslide img` selector in `highslide.css`.
The defaults for these are 45% and 20% (of the containing element), 
respectively.

Internet Explorer 9 has a bug in its CSS handling which sometimes
causes the thumbnails of SVG-images to render in wrong sizes, 
see more [here][Problems].

Example
-------

This

	[[Gallery]]:
		hsv.png
		- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation). 
		../../images/hsv.png
		lookaheads.svg
		- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing
	
produces this:

[[Gallery]]:
	hsv.png
	- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation). 
	../../images/hsv.png
	lookaheads.svg
	- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing

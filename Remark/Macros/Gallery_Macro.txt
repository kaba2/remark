Gallery macro
=============

[[Parent]]: available_macros.txt

The Gallery macro generates an image gallery. The supported image formats 
are PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG. These image formats are the ones that are 
[well-supported][ImageFormats] in browsers (as of October 2012).
Thumbnails are automatically generated for images with filename 
extensions .png, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg.

Properties
----------

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

A list of the following form:

	image1.png
	- Caption for the first image.
	- More caption for the first image.
	image2.jpg
	- Caption for the second image.
	image4.gif
	image5.svg
	...

Specification of captions is not required.

### Variables

Gallery.thumbnail_max_width 
: 	A maximum for the width of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

Gallery.thumbnail_max_height
: 	A maximum for the height of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

The pixel-count defines the resolution of the thumbnail image
for the pixel-based images; if the number of pixels is too low 
compared to the presentation size (defined by the CSS), the 
thumbnail image will look blurry.

### Multiple image formats

If an image file has multiple formats in the same directory,
say `lookaheads.png` and `lookaheads.svg`, then they are assumed
to be the same image in different formats. If there is an image 
file for which thumbnails can be generated (not .svg), then that 
image file is used to generate the thumbnail. In particular, this
covers for the fact that, as of October 2012, there aren't any good
open-source libraries for converting SVG to a pixel-based image.

### Width and height of thumbnails

To set the maximum allowed presentation width and height for
the image thumbnails, modify the `max-width` and `max-height`
properties of the `.highslide img` selector in `highslide.css`.
The defaults for these are 45% and 20% (of the containing element), 
respectively.

Example
-------

This

	[[Gallery]]:
		hsv.png
		- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation).
		- This text is appended to the caption.
		lookaheads.svg
		- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing
	
produces this:

[[Gallery]]:
	hsv.png
	- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation). 
	- This text is appended to the caption.
	lookaheads.svg
	- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing

Gallery macro
=============

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Generates an image gallery. Thumbnails are automatically generated for 
_pixel-based_ images with filename extensions .bmp, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .pcx, 
.png, .pbm, .pgm, .ppm, .tga, .tif, and .tiff. Other image-formats,
such as the vector-based .svg or .pdf, are passed on as they are.

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

A list of the following form:

	image1.png
	- Caption for the first image.
	image2.jpg
	- Caption for the second image.
	image3.bmp
	image4.tiff
	image5.svg
	...

Specification of captions is not required.

### Variables

thumbnail_max_width 
: 	A maximum for the width of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

thumbnail_max_height
: 	A maximum for the height of a thumbnail in pixels.
	Default 400.

thumbnail_width_percent
:	The width for the thumbnail in percents from
	the width of the containing element. The height
	of the thumbnail will be changed to preserve
	aspect ratio. Default 45.

Note that both types of variables are used. The pixel-count
defines the resolution of the thumbnail image; if the number
of pixels is too low compared to the presentation size (given
by the percent), the thumbnail image will look blurry.

Example
-------

This

	[[Gallery]]:
		hsv.png
		- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation). 
		../../images/hsv.png
		lookaheads.svg
		- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing
	
produces this:

[[Gallery]]:
	hsv.png
	- A visualization of the HSV color space (with full saturation). 
	../../images/hsv.png
	lookaheads.svg
	- Lookahead-sets in LC(1)-parsing

The Body macro reads the currently considered document from a file and
expands into its contents. The [[Link: ReadFile_Macro.txt]] generalizes
this macro; the Body macro is retained for compatibility.

Example
-------

This

	[[Body]]

would lead to an an infinite macro expansion loop.
This form of the macro invocation is seen only on
document templates. For demonstration purposes,
we can use:

	[[-+Verbatim]]: [[-Body]]

which produces this:

[[-+Verbatim]]: [[-Body]]

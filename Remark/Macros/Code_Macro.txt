Code macro
==========

[[Parent]]: available_macros.txt

The Code macro highlights source code. The syntax-highlighting is 
carried out by the Pygments library. If you want to specifically 
highlight C++ code, then you should look at [[Link: CppCode_Macro.txt]] 
for additional features.

Properties
----------

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

The source code to highlight.

### Variables

Code.type
: 	The type of the code. You may provide any of the Pygments lexer
	names available [here][PygmentLexers]. If this variable
	is empty, then the code-type is guessed from the content
	by Pygments. This guessing is not very reliable, so explicit
	specification should be favored. Default: Empty.

Warnings
--------

invalid-input
:	This warning is generated when the `type` is not recognized
	by Pygments.

Example
-------

This

	[[Code]]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}

produces this:
		
[[Code]]:
	int square(int x)
	{
		return x * x;
	}

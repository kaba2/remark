Code macro
==========

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

The Code macro highlights source code. The syntax-highlighting is 
carried out by the Pygments library.

Properties
----------

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

The source code to highlight.

### Variables

None.

Example
-------

This

	[[Code]]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}

produces this:
		
[[Code]]:
	int square(int x)
	{
		return x * x;
	}

If you compare this with the [CppCode][CppCode] macro
example, you'll see that the coloring is different. Possibly
because of the small size of the code snippet the
heuristic to guess the programming language has failed
in this example.

Code macro
==========

[[Parent]]: available_macros.txt

The Code macro highlights source code. The syntax-highlighting is carried out by the [Pygments][] library. If you want to specifically highlight C++ code, then you should look at [[Link: CppCode_Macro.txt]] for additional features.

[Pygments]: http://pygments.org

Properties
----------

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

The source code to highlight.

### Variables

Code.type
: 	The type of the code. You may provide any of the Pygments lexer
	names available [here][PygmentLexers]. If this variable
	is empty, then the code-type is guessed from the content
	by Pygments. If the guessing fails, then the lexer is assumed
	to be the text lexer. The guessing is not very reliable, so explicit
	specification should be favored. Default: Empty.

invalid-input

	by Pygments.

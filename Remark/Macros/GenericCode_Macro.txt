GenericCode macro
=================

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Color-encodes many kinds of source code. Outputs corresponding
html code. 

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

The parameter is interpreted as the input source code.
If the parameter is not given, the content is loaded from 
the currently processed document file. 

### Variables

None.

### Details

The type of the source code is guessed as follows:

 * If the source code is loaded from a file, its extension
 is used to take a guess.
 
 * Otherwise some heuristics are run on the source code
 and a guess is taken based on that.
 
The color-encoding is carried out by the Pygments Python library.
Note that Markdown syntax allows for inlined html.

Example
-------

This

	[[GenericCode]]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}

produces this:
		
[[GenericCode]]:
	int square(int x)
	{
		return x * x;
	}

If you compare this with the CppCode macro example,
you'll see that the coloring is different. Possibly
because of the small size of the code snippet the
heuristic to guess the programming language has failed
in this example.

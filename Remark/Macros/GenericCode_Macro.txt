GenericCode macro
=================

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Highlights many kinds of source code. Outputs corresponding
html code. 

### Output type

Html

### Output expansion default

Disabled.

### Parameters

The source code to highlight.

### Variables

None.

### Details

The color-encoding is carried out by the Pygments library.

Example
-------

This

	[[GenericCode]]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}

produces this:
		
[[GenericCode]]:
	int square(int x)
	{
		return x * x;
	}

If you compare this with the CppCode macro example,
you'll see that the coloring is different. Possibly
because of the small size of the code snippet the
heuristic to guess the programming language has failed
in this example.

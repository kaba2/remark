GenericCode macro
=================

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Color-encodes many kinds of source code. Outputs corresponding
html code. 

### Macro expansion of the output

Skipped. This is because the source code could
contain Remark macros which could get erroneously
expanded. 

### Parameters

The parameter is interpreted as the input source code.
If the parameter is not given, the content is loaded from 
the currently processed document file. 

### Variables

None.

### Details

The type of the source code is guessed as follows:

 * If the source code is loaded from a file, its extension
 is used to take a guess.
 
 * Otherwise some heuristics are run on the source code
 and a guess is taken based on that.
 
The color-encoding is carried out by the Pygments Python library.
Note that Markdown syntax allows for inlined html.

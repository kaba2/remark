Macros
======

[[Parent]]: remark_syntax.txt

Macros are functions that map input text to output text in Remark syntax. 
To introduce macros, we shall take the Comment macro as an example. 
This macro takes in arbitrary input but does not output anything. 
It can be used to comment the Remark source. 

Macro invocation
----------------

A macro can be invoked in four ways:
 
 * with no parameters,
 
 * with an inline parameter,
 
 * with a one-line parameter,
 
 * or with a multi-line parameter.

### Invoking with no parameters

The Comment macro is invoked with no parameters as follows:

	[[Comment]]

### Invoking with an inline parameter
	
With an inline parameter you would write like this:

	[[Comment: This is an inline parameter.]]
	
### Invoking with a one-line parameter

With a one-line parameter you would write like this:

	[[Comment]]: This is a one-line parameter.

### Invoking with a multi-line parameter
	
And with a multi-line parameter you would write like this:

	[[Comment]]:
		This is a multi-line parameter
		which can use as many rows as needed.
		
The parameter is multi-line whenever:

 * There is the ':' mark after the macro invocation.

 * There is only white-space after the ':' on the same row.

The range of a multi-line parameter extends downwards
until there is a line which contains non-white-space
characters _and_ which has indentation (counted in _tabs_) 
equal to or less than the indentation of the macro invocation. 
For example:
    
	[[Comment]]:
		This is a multi-line parameter
		which can use as many rows as needed.
		
		This is still part of the multi-line parameter.
		
	This is not part of the Comment parameter.

Macro expansion
---------------

Whether the output of a macro invocation is recursively
expanded is decided by the given macro. By default, the
parameter of a macro invocation is not expanded. One can
change this behavior by prefixing the macro name with a +.
For example, this:

	[[set a: Nom]]
	[[set b]]: [[get a]]
	[[get b]]
	[[+set b]]: [[get a]]
	[[get b]]
	
produces this:
 
[[set a: Nom]]
[[set b]]: [[get a]]
[[get b]]
[[+set b]]: [[get a]]
[[get b]]

The macros can be placed freely as shown in the following
example:

	Nom[[get b]] [[get b]]Nom[[get b]] Nom[[get b]]

Nom[[get b]] [[get b]]Nom[[get b]] Nom[[get b]]

Some details
------------

 * A multi-line parameter with a single row works equivalently
to a one-line parameter. 

 * A multi-line parameter with no rows works equivalently to as 
 if no parameters were given.
 
 * A one-line parameter works equivalently to an inline parameter.
 
 * If both an inline parameter and an external parameter is given, 
 then the latter follows the former and they work equivalently
 to a corresponding multi-line parameter. 

 * The functionality of macros is implemented as Python classes.
During its action, a macro has access to the whole
functionality offered by Remark. Most importantly macros
have access to the documentation tree. This way macros
are able to produce the correct descriptions and link
targets which have been deduced from the Remark source files.

 * No macro expansions are done for verbatim content.

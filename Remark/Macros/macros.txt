Macros

[[Parent]]: remark_syntax.txt

A _macro_ is a function which maps input text in some syntax to output 
text in Remark syntax. The functionality of a macro is implemented 
as a Python class. During its action, a macro has access to the whole
functionality offered by Remark, including the document-tree, variables,
and tags. This way macros are able to produce the correct descriptions 
and link targets which have been deduced from the Remark source files.

Equation macro
==============

[[Parent]]: available_macros.txt

The Equation macro presents mathematics given in the AsciiMathML syntax,
together with a running number. The equation is wrapped into an html-span, 
which is then followed by an equation-number html-span. Finally, these 
two span elements are wrapped into an equation html-div.

=============

[[Parent]]: macros.txt

Description
-----------

### Action

Color-encodes C and C++ source code. Outputs corresponding
html code. 

### Macro expansion of the output

Skipped. This is because the C++ source code could
contain Remark macros which could get erroneously
expanded. 

### Parameters

The parameter is interpreted as the input C++ source code.
If the parameter is not given, the content is loaded from 
the currently processed document file. 

### Variables

None.

### Details

The color-encoding is carried out by the Pygments Python library.
Note that Markdown syntax allows for inlined html.

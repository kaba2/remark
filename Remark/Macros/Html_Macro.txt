Html macro
==========

[[Parent]]: available_macros.txt

The Html macro copies its input as it is. Its purpose is to embed 
html directly into the generated html page. While the Markdown syntax 
also allows embedding html directly, the problem with that approach is 
that newlines are interpreted as ending the html block.

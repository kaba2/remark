Orphan document type
====================

[[Parent]]: document_types.txt

The Orphan document type is used to generate a page which
lists its documentation children as well as its source children.
Remark makes use of this document type by creating a 
virtual `orphan.remark-orphan` node in the root of document tree,
called the _orphan node_. Those documents which do not
find a parent document elsewhere are assigned as children
of the orphan node. The role of the orphan document is
to generate a useful check report to see that one hasn't
forgotten to link some important documents properly into 
the documentation.

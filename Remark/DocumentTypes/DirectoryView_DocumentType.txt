DirectoryView document type
===========================

[[Parent]]: document_types.txt

The DirectoryView document type offers a view of the containing directory 
of such a document. This is a listing of all the directories and files
in the document tree that are contained in the same directory as the 
document.

Rather than having to physically create a file with this document type,
Remark creates such documents virtually and automatically into the 
document tree. One such document is generated into each directory and 
is named `directory.remark-index`.

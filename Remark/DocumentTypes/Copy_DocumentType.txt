Specification of tags
---------------------

The parent document is specified by writing somewhere in the file 

	[[Parent]]: name_of_parent.txt 

You might notice that this is also a macro invocation.
This is indeed the case: the Parent macro has been given
a double-role both as a tag and a macro.   

The description is extracted from the first encountered heading.
The detailed description is not used (but you can set it yourself
with the [set_tag][Tags] command if needed).

[Tags]: [[Ref]]: tags.txt

RemarkPage document type
========================

[[Parent]]: document_types.txt

The RemarkPage document type is used to write the part of the 
documentation that can't be generated automatically. The page
you are reading right now has been generated from a document of
this type. RemarkPage is special among document types in that
is sometimes given priority, such as when finding a parent 
document by implicit rules. RemarkPage documents load the content
from a file by the Body macro, and assume that the loaded content 
is in [[Link: remark_syntax.txt]].

Properties
----------

Name
:	RemarkPage

Input extension
: 	.txt

Output extension
: 	.htm

AsciiMath interpretation
:	Enabled

Document template
: 

		[[set RemarkPage.mid_text]]
		[[set RemarkPage.end_text]]
		[[Body]]
		[[DocChildren]]
		[[RemarkPage.mid_text]]
		[[SourceChildren]]
		[[RemarkPage.end_text]]

	The purpose of the variables `RemarkPage.mid_text` and
	`RemarkPage.end_text` is to give the documentation
	writer some freedom over positioning. For example, the
	following can be used to place a link list at the end
	of the document:
	
		[[set_outer RemarkPage.end_text]]:
			Links
			-----
			
			[[Link]]: some_file.txt

Document syntax
:	Remark

Specification of tags
---------------------

The parent document is specified by writing somewhere in the file 

	[[Parent]]: name_of_parent.txt 

You might notice that this is also a macro invocation.
This is indeed the case: the Parent macro has been given
a double-role both as a tag and a macro.   

The description is extracted from the first encountered heading.
The detailed description is not used (but you can set it yourself
with the [set_tag][Tags] command if needed).

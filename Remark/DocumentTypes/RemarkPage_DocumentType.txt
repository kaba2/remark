RemarkPage document type
========================

[[Parent]]: document_types.txt

The RemarkPage document type converts a document in Remark
syntax to an html-page. RemarkPage is special among document 
types in that is sometimes given priority, such as when finding a 
parent document by implicit rules. 

Properties
----------

Name
:	RemarkPage

Input extension
: 	.txt

Output extension
: 	.htm

Input syntax
:	Remark

Output syntax
:	Html

Generating Remark text
:	

		[[set RemarkPage.mid_text]]
		[[set RemarkPage.end_text]]
		[[+ReadFile]]: [[tag file_name]]
		[[DocChildren]]
		[[RemarkPage.mid_text]]
		[[SourceChildren]]
		[[RemarkPage.end_text]]

The purpose of the variables `RemarkPage.mid_text` and
`RemarkPage.end_text` is to give the documentation
writer some freedom over positioning. For example, the
following can be used to place a link list at the end
of the document:
	
	[[set_outer RemarkPage.end_text]]:
		Links
		-----
			
		[[Link]]: some_file.txt

Specification of tags
---------------------

The parent document is specified by writing somewhere in the file 

[[Verbatim]]: [[Parent]]: name_of_parent.txt 

You might notice that this is also a macro invocation.
This is indeed the case: the Parent macro has been given
a double-role both as a tag and a macro.   

The description is extracted from the first encountered heading.
The detailed description is not used (but you can set it yourself
with the [set_tag][Tags] command if needed).

Option files
============

[[Parent]]: user_documentation.txt

An _option-file_ is a plain-text file which contains one option per line. 

The option files are available for compatibility; we recommend using [configuration files][Config] instead.

Motivation
----------

Using an option-file is advantageous because

 * the file is not affected by the command-line glob-expansion,
 * it reduces repetitive specification of the files and options.

The `remark_options` file is always read as an option-file if it exists. 
Additional option-files can be specified with the `-o` option.

Example
-------

Instead of running

	remark.py . docs "*.txt" "*.py" "*.png" -x "docs/*"

one can run
	
	remark.py . docs

where the `remark_options` file contains

	*.txt
	*.py
	*.png
	-x docs/*

taken into account.

Third-party libraries
---------------------

The Python Markdown and Pygments libraries are licensed under
the BSD license. These libraries are firmly integrated, and 
have an essential role, in Remark. The other libraries are 
optional as follows.

 * The AsciiMathML javascript-library is referred to in an html-page 
 if and only if one uses the math-mode in the Remark-source
 of that page.
 
 * The AsciiMathML javascript-library is copied to the output
 directory if and only if some generated html-page refers to it.
 
 * The Highslide javascript-library is referred to in an html-page 
 if and only if one invokes the Gallery-macro to generate 
 that page.
 
 * The Highslide javascript-library is copied to the output
 directory if and only if some generated html-page refers to it.

The Python Imaging Library is used by the [[Link: Gallery_Macro.txt]] to
create thumbnails automatically.

Commercial use
--------------

Remark is free for use in commercial products for the most part. 
The only exception is the use of the Gallery-macro which depends 
on the Python Imaging Library and the Highslide library. To use 
the Gallery-macro in commercial products, you need to obtain the 
commercial licenses for these products.

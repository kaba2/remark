License matters
===============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

Remark is licensed under the GNU Lesser GPL, which makes using it
quite free. However, Remark uses some third-party libraries
whose licenses have to be taken into account also. 

Third-party libraries
---------------------

The Python Markdown and Pygments libraries are licensed under
the BSD license, which is very allowing. These libraries are
firmly integrated into Remark and therefore have essential
roles in Remark. The other libraries are optional as follows.

 * The AsciiMathML javascript library is referred to in an html
 page if and only if one uses the math mode in the Remark source
 of that page.
 
 * The AsciiMathML javascript library is copied to the output
 directory if and only if some generated html page refers to it.
 
 * The Highslide javascript library is referred to in an html 
 page if and only if one invokes the Gallery macro to generate 
 that page.
 
 * The Highslide javascript library is copied to the output
 directory if and only if some generated html page refers to it.

The Python Imaging Library is used by the Gallery macro to
create thumbnails automatically.

Commercial use
--------------

Remark is free for use in commercial products for the most part. 
The only exception is the use of Gallery macro which depends on
Python Imaging Library and the Highslide library. To use the
Gallery macro in commercial products, you need to obtain the 
commercial licenses for those products.

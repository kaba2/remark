### Unicode source files 

In Remark, the documentation is written in plain UTF-8 text files. UTF-8 is a (Unicode) 
text encoding scheme which is compatible with ASCII encoding in the sense that ASCII 
encoded text files are automatically valid UTF-8 text files. However,
in contrast to ASCII text files, a UTF-8 text file can also represent
the more exotic characters if needed. A UTF-8 text file consist of nothing else than 
a sequence of Unicode characters, which you can edit using the text editor 
of your choice.

### Human-readable, non-redundant content description 

The Remark syntax used to write the documentation is just a slightly extended 
version of the _Markdown_ syntax. This syntax fulfills the following goals:
 
 * The representation is decoupled from the content.  
 
 * The content description (i.e. Remark source) is as human-readable 
 as possible.
 
 * There is minimal redundancy. 

The first item means that the Remark syntax covers only structural matters 
(e.g. a section, a sub-section, a table, emphasis, etc). The 
representation of the content (colors, fonts, etc.) can be 
arbitrarily changed later without touching the content (using _Cascading
Style Sheets_). Here's an example of the Remark syntax from the source of this page:

	### Human-readable, non-redundant content description 
	
	The Remark syntax used to write the documentation is just a slightly extended 
	version of the _Markdown_ syntax. This syntax fulfills the following goals:
	 
	 * The representation is decoupled from the content.  
	 
	 * The content description (i.e. Remark source) is as human-readable 
	 as possible.
	 
	 * There is minimal redundancy. 

The source code is first converted from Remark syntax to Markdown syntax
by expanding the Remark macros. After that the Markdown syntax is converted 
to html using the _Markdown_ Python library. 

### Human-readable typesetting of mathematics

In its original form, Markdown syntax lacks the ability to typeset mathematics. 
To remedy this, Remark extends the Markdown syntax with the _AsciiMath_ 
syntax. AsciiMath is a syntax which formalizes a commonly used notation 
for mathematical formulas. Similar notations have been used for decades 
in newsgroup discussions where only ASCII characters are available for 
typesetting mathematics. AsciiMath fulfills the following goal:

 * The description of the formulas are as human-readable as possible.

An example of the AsciiMath syntax is given by:
	
	x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a) 
	
which generates:
	
''x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)''

Contrast this to e.g. Latex syntax. The conversion of the AsciiMath syntax 
to MathML is handled on the fly via the _AsciiMathML_ java-script library.

### Color-encoding of source code

Remark integrates the browsing of source code into the documentation.
When viewing source code, it is color-encoded using the _Pygments_
Python library. As an example, here's how to embed a source code snippet (C++ code):

	[[CppCode]]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}

And here's how it looks like:
		
[[CppCode]]:
	int square(int x)
	{
		return x * x;
	}

### Automatic generation of links

Usually each document in documentation can be given a title or some 
kind of a description. When building documentation manually, one
faces the task of building links between documents and naming
each of them with the description of the target document. However,
this quickly becomes a maintenance problem because the link 
descriptions will need to be corrected every time the target 
document's description changes. Remark solves this problem by
embedding to each document its description. This way links can be
named automatically by fetching the description of the target
document. 

Most often a documentation has a tree structure. This means that each 
document has a well-defined parent document with the subject of the 
matter generalizing towards the parent. Again, when building links
between parents and children, one is faced with a maintenance problem:
if one changes a parent of a document, then one should remember to
remove a link from the old parent and insert a link to the new parent.
Remark solves this problem by embedding to each document its parent.
This way the links between a parent and a child can be generated
(and named) automatically. 

Documentation files such as this page have their descriptions set to 
their first heading from the top. Their parent documentation is given
like this:

	[[Parent]]: name_of_parent.txt 

The description and parent documentation for a source code file are 
embedded into it using comments. For example, here's
what reads at the start of the file _Convert.py_ (a Python source code 
file of Remark):

	# Description: Macro expansion algorithm, variables, and html conversion.
	# Documentation: implementation.txt

Problems and solutions

What if I pass a non-UTF-8 encoded file to Remark?
--------------------------------------------------

If you pass Remark a file that is not a valid UTF-8 encoding, Remark 
emits a warning and assumes that the file has been encoded in Latin-1. 
This process is a bit inefficient since in this case the file has to be 
read twice.  

Why are some parts incorrectly interpreted as mathematical expressions?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the AsciiMathML Javascript library affects the whole 
generated page and can't be scoped. This is problematic in some cases. 
For example, in Python code an empty string is denoted by two 
subsequent '. This will be erased from the output because AsciiMathML 
interprets it as a start of a mathematical expression.
Remark solves this problem partially by making it configurable per 
document type whether AsciiMath should be interpreted or not: currently
only documentation files (.txt) are interpreted. It would be nice if 
there were a Python library that did AsciiMath to MathML conversion...

How can I write verbatim content directly after a multi-line parameter?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Indentation has a double role. It is used both to denote
verbatim content in Markdown and to denote the range of a multi-line
parameter for a macro in Remark. Therefore, if one wants to write
verbatim content directly after a multi-line parameter, there must
be some way to tell Remark where the multi-line parameter
ends. A way to solve this problem without including
extra content is to use the Comment macro either without
a parameter or with a one-line parameter. For example:

	[[CppCode]]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}
		
		int cube(int x)
		{
			return x * x * x;
		}
	
	[[Comment]]: This comment marks the end of the parameter.
	
		Verbatim content here. 

We expect this to be a rather rare problem. Most of the time
verbatim content is preceded by an explanation which at the
same time marks the end of a parameter. For example:
		
	[[CppCode]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}
		
		int cube(int x)
		{
			return x * x * x;
		}

	This sentence marks the end of the parameter.

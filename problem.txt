How can I write verbatim content directly after a multi-line parameter?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Indentation has a double role. It is used both to denote
verbatim content in Markdown and to denote the range of a multi-line
parameter for a macro in Remark. Therefore, if one wants to write
verbatim content directly after a multi-line parameter, there must
be some way to tell Remark where the multi-line parameter
ends. A way to solve this problem without including
extra content is to use the Comment macro either without
a parameter or with a one-line parameter. For example:

	[[CppCode]]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}
		
		int cube(int x)
		{
			return x * x * x;
		}
	
	[[Comment]]: This comment marks the end of the parameter.
	
		Verbatim content here. 

We expect this to be a rather rare problem. Most of the time
verbatim content is preceded by an explanation which at the
same time marks the end of a parameter. For example:
		
	[[CppCode]:
		int square(int x)
		{
			return x * x;
		}
		
		int cube(int x)
		{
			return x * x * x;
		}

	This sentence marks the end of the parameter.
	Here's some verbatim content:

This same technique can also be used to produce subsequent regions 
of verbatim content.

AsciiMathML can not be scoped
-----------------------------

For example, in Python code there might be an
empty string denoted by two subsequent '.
This will be erased from the output because
AsciiMathML interprets this as a start of 
a mathematical expression.
Unfortunately I am not aware of any ways to
scope the AsciiMathML to not consider all
places.

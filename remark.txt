_Remark_ is a Python command-line script and a Python library to generate 
html documentation for software libraries. Remark is documented with Remark, 
the results of which you are inspecting right now. The version documented 
here is [[remark_version]]. The latest version can always be found from 
[here][RemarkHomepage].

Usage
-----

From the command-line (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, ...): 

	remark.py inputDirectory outputDirectory (option|file-glob)*

### Example

From the command-line, run

	remark.py . docs 

where the `remark_options` file in the input directory 
contains

	*.txt
	*.py
	*.png
	-x docs/*

Alternatively, the same can be achieved without using an option-file by

	remark.py . docs "*.txt" "*.py" "*.png" -x "docs/*"

### Linux and Mac OS X

The shells on Linux and Mac OS X expand the globs (e.g `*.txt`) _before_ running 
an executable (unless the globs do not match anything in the current directory).
Therefore, on the command-line the globs should always be  provided in the 
form `"*.txt"`, to defer the glob-expansion from the shell to Remark.

Installation

_Remark_ is a Python library to generate html documentation for software libraries.
Naturally, Remark is documented with Remark, the results of which you are inspecting
right now. 

Usage
-----

From the console (Windows, Linux, Unix, ...): 

	remark.py [options] inputDirectory outputDirectory [filesToCopy...]

See the installation instructions below.

News

### 10.03.2010: Released Remark 1.2.0

#### Core

 * Allowed free positioning of Remark macros. 
 * Added the ability to invoke macros via inline parameters.
 * Added explicit control over parameter and output
 expansion behavior in macro invocation.
 * Allowed local variables for macros.
 * Added `set_outer`, `add_outer`, and `outer` commands to 
 set, append, and retrieve variables at outer scopes, respectively.
 * Allowed parameter passing for variables to turn
 them into user-defined text transformations. 
 * Variables can now be retrieved simply by their name,
 rather than having to use `get`. 
 * Added `set_many` command to set variables easily.
 * Fixed a bug in `filesToCopy` pattern matching:
 a file was copied only if it matched all patterns.
  
#### Macros

 * Added FileLink macro to generate links with the link 
 description set to the filename of the target.
 * Added the implicit file searching algorithm for pure 
 filenames into various macros. 
 * DocChildren and Index macros now use 2 or 3 columns to 
 list the items if there are more than 7 of them.
 * Added Html macro to embed html directly.
 * Added Gallery macro to generate image galleries.
 * Added Verbatim macro to reinterpret text as
 verbatim content.
 * Added DirectoryLink macro to generate links to
 the containing directories of files.
 * Added Copy macro to copy the input without changes.
 * Added Ref macro to return the relative filenames of 
 the output documents.
 * Removed SkipExpansion macro. Its effect can
 be obtained with the Copy macro.

#### Interface

 * Added the option to merge a prologue file to the
 beginning of each document template.

#### Additional dependencies

 * Dependence to _Python Imaging Library_ via Gallery macro.
 * Optional dependence to _Highslide_ javascript library
 via Gallery macro.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions at all. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.

Remark was programmed under funding from the 
[Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion][TES]

Remark was preceded by a similar implementation
called _LightMark_ programmed by [Juho Hämäläinen][Juho].
The ideas gathered and tested in that implementation
was the basis on which Remark was built.
He should be attributed the idea of using
Markdown for writing the documentation.

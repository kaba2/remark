Remark

_Remark_ is a Python library to generate html documentation for software
libraries. Remark is documented with Remark, the results of which you are
inspecting right now.

Usage
-----

From the console (Windows, Linux, Mac, ...): 

	remark.py inputDirectory outputDirectory (option|file-glob)*

For example:

	remark.py . docs "*.txt" "*.py" "*.png" -x "docs/*"

### Linux and Mac users

The shells on Linux and Mac expand the globs (e.g \*.txt) _before_ running an
executable (unless the globs do not match anything in the current directory).
Therefore, on the _command-line_ the globs should always be  provided in the 
form "\*.txt", to defer the glob-expansion from the shell to Remark.

### Option files

Command-line options can be refactored into option-files. An option-file is 
a plain text file which contains one option per line. Using an option-file 
is advantageous because

 * its options are not affected by the command-line glob-expansion,
 * it reduces repetitive specification of the files and options.

The `remark_options` file is always read as an option-file if it exists. 
Additional option-files can be specified with the `-o` option. For example, 
the above example can be rewritten as
	
	remark.py . docs

where the `remark_options` file contains

	*.txt
	*.py
	*.png
	-x docs/*

Installation
------------

In the following we will assume that Python 2.7 has been installed
properly, as described in [here][InstallPython]. In particular, we
assume that `pip` has been installed. Remark is then installed
from the command-line by typing

	pip install remark

Depending on your operating system, you may need to explicitly run
the command under administrator rights (e.g. by prepending `sudo` 
in Mac OS X).

Source code
-----------

You may also download the full source code for Remark,
which includes the Remark source for this documentation.

### [Download Remark 1.6.0 Source Code][SourceCode]

[SourceCode]: ./files/remark-1.6.0.zip

For previous versions, see the [release history][History].

Manual installation
-------------------

If for some reason you want to install Remark without
using `pip`, then you must

 * download the source code,
 * extract the source code to some desired directory,
 * install the [dependencies][Dependencies], and 
 * add the directory containing `remark.py` to the path 
 variable of the operating system.

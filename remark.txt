_Remark_ is a Python library to generate html documentation for software libraries.
Naturally, Remark is documented with Remark, the results of which you are inspecting
right now. Remark is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_. 

Usage
-----

From the console (Windows, Linux, Unix, ...): 

	remark.py [options] inputDirectory outputDirectory [filesToCopy...]

See the installation instructions below.

News

### 24.02.2010: Released Remark 1.2.0

 * Feature: Added the ability to invoke macros via inline parameters.
 
 * Feature: Added FileLink macro to generate links with the link 
 description set to the filename of the target.
 
 * Change: Allowed inline placement of Remark macros for inline
 parameters and empty parameters. 
 
### 23.01.2010: Released Remark 1.1.0

 * Feature: Added option parsing to console interface.
 
 * Feature: Non-converted files are now copied only if they match
 a filename-pattern specified at the command line (filesToCopy arguments).
 
 * Feature: Tag-parsers now only read at most 100 lines from a file
 (configurable via the option -l). This speeds up the parsing of
 tags.

### 13.01.2010: Released Remark 1.0.1

 * Bug-fix: some directories were written in Windows-style 
 backslashes into the html files depending on which OS was
 used to run Remark.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions at all. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.

Remark was programmed under funding from the 
[Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion][TES]

Remark was preceded by a similar implementation
called _LightMark_ programmed by [Juho Hämäläinen][Juho].
The ideas gathered and tested in that implementation
was the basis on which Remark was built.
He should be attributed the idea of using
Markdown for writing the documentation.

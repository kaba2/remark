right now. Remark is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_.

### 24.02.2010: Released Remark 1.2.0

#### Core

 * Allowed free positioning of Remark macros. 
 * Added the ability to invoke macros via inline parameters.
 * Added `set_many` command to set variables easily.
 * Fixed a bug in `filesToCopy` pattern matching:
 a file was copied only if it matched all patterns. 
 
#### Macros

 * Added FileLink macro to generate links with the link 
 description set to the filename of the target.
 * Added implicit searching rules for pure filenames 
 into the Link and FileLink macros. 
 * DocChildren macro now uses 2 or 3 columns to list
 the children if there are more than 7 of them.
 * Added Html macro to embed html directly.
 * Added Gallery macro to generate image galleries.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions at all. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.

Remark was programmed under funding from the 
[Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion][TES]

Remark was preceded by a similar implementation
called _LightMark_ programmed by [Juho Hämäläinen][Juho].
The ideas gathered and tested in that implementation
was the basis on which Remark was built.
He should be attributed the idea of using
Markdown for writing the documentation.

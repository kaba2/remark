_Remark_ is a Python command-line script and a Python library to generate 
html documentation for software libraries. Remark is documented with Remark, 
the results of which you are inspecting right now. The version documented 
here is [[remark_version]]. The latest version can always be found from 
[here][RemarkHomepage].

Usage
-----

From the command-line (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, ...): 

	remark.py inputDirectory outputDirectory (option|file-glob)*

### Linux and Mac OS X

The shells on Linux and Mac OS X expand the globs (e.g `*.txt`) _before_ 
running an executable (unless the globs do not match anything in the 
current directory). Therefore, on the command-line the globs should always 
be  provided in the form `"*.txt"`, to defer the glob-expansion from the 
shell to Remark.

### Example

Perhaps the best example is to build the documentation of Remark itself. 
After obtaining the source code for Remark, assuming you are at the root
directory of the source code, run from the command-line

	remark.py . docs -v

The `-v` option produces additional progress information. The other used 
options can be found the `remark_options` file. The resulting documentation 
can be read by opening `docs/remark.htm`.

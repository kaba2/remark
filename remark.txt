Usage
-----

From the command-line (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, ...): 

	remark.py inputDirectory outputDirectory (option|file-glob)*

### Linux and Mac OS X

The shells on Linux and Mac OS X expand the globs (e.g `*.txt`) _before_ running an executable (unless the globs do not match anything in the current directory). Therefore, on the command-line the globs should always be  provided in the form `"*.txt"`, to defer the glob-expansion from the shell to Remark.

### Example

Perhaps the best example is to build the documentation of Remark itself. After obtaining the source code for Remark --- assuming you are at the root directory of the source code --- run from the command-line

	remark.py . docs -v

The `-v` option produces additional progress information. The other used options can be found from the `remark_config.json` file. The resulting documentation can be read by opening `docs/remark.htm`.

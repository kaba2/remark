Download
--------

[Download Remark as a Python library][Library]

[Download Remark as a Windows executable][Executable]

[Library]: ./files/remark_1.0.zip
[Executable]: ./files/remark_winexe_1.0.zip
	
Usage
-----

From Windows console: 

	remark.py inputDirectory outputDirectory

This works because files with the .py extension are associated to
be run with the installed Python interpreter. 
	
From Linux, Unix, etc. console:

	./remark.py inputDirectory outputDirectory

This works because there is a shebang at the start of remark.py
which associates a Python interpreter to run the file.

Remark was preceded by a similar implementation
called LightMark programmed by _Juho Hamalainen_.
The ideas gathered and tested in that implementation
was the basis on which Remark was built.
He should be attributed the idea of using
Markdown for writing the documentation.

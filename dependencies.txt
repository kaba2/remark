Dependencies
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

This section describes the dependencies of Remark. You should not need this 
information to install Remark; the `pip` handles the installation of
the dependencies as part of the installation of Remark. However, if this
does not work for some reason, we also describe here the manual installation 
of the dependencies.

Python
------

Remark was programmed in Python 2.7. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where x is at least 7. The syntaxes 
of Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible. For instructions on 
installing Python 2.7, see [here][PythonInstall]. In the following we 
will assume that you have the `easy_install` and `pip` working, as 
described in the link. These are the tools for installing additional 
Python libraries.

Python dependencies
-------------------

The dependencies to other Python libraries are as follows:
 
### [Python Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown20]

This library is used to convert Markdown to Html. 
To install Python Markdown, type on the command-line:

	pip install markdown==2.0.0

Note that the newer [Python Markdown 2.2][PythonMarkdown22] does 
not work with Remark, because it does not support Markdown inside
html blocks.
 
### [Pygments 1.5][Pygments]

This library is used to highlight source code. 
To install Pygments, type on the command-line:

	easy_install Pygments
 
### [Python Imaging Library 1.1.7][PIL]

This library is used to create thumbnails for image galleries.
The installation of [Python Imaging Library][PIL] (PIL) depends on
your operating system and whether your Python is 32-bit or 64-bit.

#### MacOSX and Linux

On the command-line, type:

	pip install pil

#### Windows (32-bit Python)

Install Python Imaging Library using a 32-bit installer from [here][PIL_Installer].
On Windows 7 (and Vista?), make sure that you run the installer as an administrator 
(right click --> run as administrator).

#### Windows (64-bit Python)

Install Python Imaging Library using a 64-bit installer from [here][PIL-64]. 
On Windows 7 (and Vista?), make sure that you run the installer as an administrator 
(right click --> run as administrator).

Javascript dependencies
-----------------------

The Javascript dependencies are on a per-page basis depending on 
which features the page uses. The dependencies to Javascript libraries 
are as follows.

### [Highslide][Highslide]

This library is used to view image galleries. 
We distribute it with Remark.
 
### [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML]

This library is used to convert AsciiMath to MathML. 
We distribute it with Remark.

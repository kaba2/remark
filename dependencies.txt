Dependencies
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

This section describes the dependencies of Remark. You do not need this 
information to install Remark; the `pip` handles the installation of
the dependencies as part of the installation of Remark. 

Python
------

Remark was programmed in Python 2.7. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where x is at least 7. The syntaxes 
of Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible. For instructions on 
installing Python 2.7, see [here][PythonInstall].

Python dependencies
-------------------

The dependencies to other Python libraries are as follows:
 
### [Python Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown20]

This library is used to convert Markdown to Html. 
Note that the newer [Python Markdown 2.2][PythonMarkdown22] does 
not work with Remark, because it does not support Markdown inside
html blocks.
 
### [Pygments 1.5][Pygments]

This library is used to highlight source code. 
 
### [Pillow 2.0][Pillow]

This library is used to create thumbnails for image galleries.
On Windows, this dependency is not automatically installed by 
`pip` when installing Remark. Instead, it must be installed 
separately with `easy_install`. The reason for this is that 
`pip install pillow` builds the Pillow library from C++ source 
code, and thus on Windows requires a specific version of Visual 
Studio to work. In contrast, `easy_install` provides a prebuilt 
binary distribution of Pillow.

Javascript dependencies
-----------------------

The Javascript dependencies are on a per-page basis depending on 
which features the page uses. The dependencies to Javascript libraries 
are as follows.

### [Highslide][Highslide]

This library is used to view image galleries. 
We distribute it with Remark.
 
### [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML]

This library is used to convert AsciiMath to MathML. 
We distribute it with Remark.

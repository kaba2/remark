Dependencies
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

This section describes the dependencies of Remark. You do not need this 
information to install Remark; the `pip` handles the installation of
the dependencies as part of the installation of Remark. 

Python
------

Remark was programmed in Python 2.7. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where x is at least 7. The syntaxes 
of Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible. For instructions on 
installing Python 2.7, see [here][PythonInstall].

Python dependencies
-------------------

The dependencies to other Python libraries are as follows:
 
### [Python Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown20]

This library is used to convert Markdown to Html. 
Note that the newer [Python Markdown 2.2][PythonMarkdown22] does 
not work with Remark, because it does not support Markdown inside
html blocks.
 
### [Pygments 1.5][Pygments]

This library is used to highlight source code. 
 
### [Pillow 2.0][Pillow]

This library is used to create thumbnails for image galleries.
Unfortunately this library can not be installed automatically as 
a dependency in `pip`, since on Windows `pip install pillow` builds 
the Pillow library from C++ source code, and thus requires a specific 
version of Visual Studio to work. In contrast, `easy_install pillow` 
provides a prebuilt binary distribution of Pillow.

Javascript dependencies
-----------------------

The Javascript dependencies are on a per-page basis depending on 
which features the page uses. The dependencies to Javascript libraries 
are as follows.

### [Highslide][Highslide]

This library is used to view image galleries. 
We distribute it with Remark.

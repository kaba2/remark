Implicit rules
==============

[[Parent]]: user_documentation.txt

A large part of the convenience of Remark relies on implicit
rules which fill in the details when those are not given.
These rules are constructed such that most of the time they
do the right thing. Such implicit rules save work by minimizing
the effort that needs to be done to build and maintain the
documentation. 

Implicit description
--------------------

Often a group of documents can be described by a single description. 
To reduce the number of tag embeddings in these cases, Remark defines 
the following implicit rules:

 * Files which reside in the same directory and have the same name without 
 the extension share the same description.
 
 * A document which does not have a description after the previous rule 
 is given (if exists) the description of the source file which:
 	1. is in the same directory
 	2. has a description
 	3. without the extension has a filename which is the longest prefix 
 	of the name of the to-be-described file.

Implicit parent
---------------

If a document with the RemarkPage type does not specify a parent, 
it is assigned the orphan node as the parent. If some other type of document
does not specify a parent, Remark gives the file an implicitly-defined 
parent. The logic for this goes as follows:

 * In the same directory, search for the longest prefix file (excluding the 
 file itself). Give documents with RemarkPage type priority over other 
 documents. Only consider those files which have a parent document. If there 
 are multiple candidate files, pick one arbitrarily (Remark reports a warning 
 about the ambiguity). 
 
 * If a document with the RemarkPage type is found, assign it as a parent. 

 * Otherwise, if some other type of document is found, assign its parent 
 as a parent. 

 * Otherwise, assign the orphan node as a parent.

Installation
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

Remark was programmed using Python 2.6. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where x is at least 6. Note that the syntaxes of 
Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible.

The dependencies to other libraries are as follows:
 
 * [Python Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown] (presumably newer versions also work)
 
 * [Pygments 1.2.2][Pygments] (presumably newer versions also work)
 
 * [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML] (Javascript, we distribute this along Remark)

The AsciiMathML dependency is on a per-page basis depending on whether
the page contains mathematical expressions or not. After installing a 
Python interpreter, Python Markdown, and Pygments you should be ready 
to use Remark.

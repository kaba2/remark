Installation
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

Remark was programmed using Python 2.7. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where x is at least 7. Note that the syntaxes of 
Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible.

Python dependencies
-------------------

The dependencies to other Python libraries are as follows:
 
### [Python Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown]

This library is used to convert Markdown to Html.
 
### [Pygments 1.5][Pygments]

This library is used to highlight source code. 
 
### [Python Imaging Library 1.1.7][PIL]

This library is used to create thumbnails for image galleries. 
 
Javascript dependencies
-----------------------

The Javascript dependencies are on a per-page basis depending on 
which features the page uses. The dependencies to Javascript libraries 
are as follows.

### [Highslide][Highslide]

This library is used to view image galleries. 
We distribute it with Remark.
 
### [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML]

This library is used to convert AsciiMath to MathML. 
We distribute it with Remark.

Notes on Windows 7 (and other 64-bit Windows?)
----------------------------------------------

The installers for the Python Markdown 2.0 and Python Imaging
Library 1.1.7 do not work in Windows 7 (when writing this in
18.06.2012). The solution for the Python Imaging Library is 
to obtain a 64-bit installer from [here][PIL-64].

[PIL-64]: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

The solution for the Markdown installer is to first write the 
following in Notepad:

	Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 

	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python] 
	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python\Pythoncore]
	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python\Pythoncore\2.7] 
	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python\Pythoncore\2.7\InstallPath]
	@="C:\\Python27" 
	[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python\Pythoncore\2.7\PythonPath]
	@="C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Lib\\;C:\\Python27\\DLLs\\"

save this in a file with extension .reg, and then run it using 
Registry Editor (right click --> Open with). Then the installer
should run through. Do note to replace the Python version, and the
Python directory above if they are not what you use.

At first it would seem that this also helps with the Python Imaging 
Library installer. This is true to the extent that the installation
itself is successful. However, the package contains a 32-bit 
.dll which does not run in a 64-bit Windows.
 
Installation
------------

After installing a Python interpreter, Python Markdown, Pygments, 
and the Python Imaging Library you should be ready to use Remark.

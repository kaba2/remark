Installation
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

The installation procedure depends on whether you want to
run Remark through the Python interpreter or through an
executable.

### Using a Python interpreter

Remark was programmed using Python 2.6. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where ''x >= 6''. Note that the syntaxes of 
Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible.

The dependencies to other libraries are as follows:
 
 * [Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown] (Python, presumably newer versions also work)
 
 * [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML] (Javascript, we distribute this along Remark)
 
[PythonMarkdown]: http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/
[AsciiMathML]: http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/asciimath.html

After installing a Python interpreter and Markdown Python library you should
be ready to use Remark.

### Using an executable

Using _py2exe_, a Python program can be converted to an executable
so that one does not need to install a Python interpreter or the
dependencies. In this case one does not need to do anything to
install Remark apart from downloading the package.
This conversion simply encapsulates all the needed stuff into
an executable. Note that this process does not speed up the execution 
of Remark.

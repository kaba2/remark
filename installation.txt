Installation
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

Remark was programmed using Python 2.6. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where x is at least 6. Note that the syntaxes of 
Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible.

The dependencies to other libraries are as follows:
 
 * [Python Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown] to convert Markdown to Html. 
 It is a Python library.
 
 * [Pygments 1.2.2][Pygments] to highlight source code. 
 It is a Python library.
 
 * [Python Imaging Library 1.1.7][PIL] to create thumbnails for image galleries. 
 It is A Python library.
 
 * [Highslide][Highslide] to view image galleries. 
 It is a Javascript library which we distribute along Remark.
 
 * [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML] to convert AsciiMath to MathML. 
 It is a Javascript library which we distribute along Remark.

The Javascript dependencies are on a per-page basis depending on whether
the page uses those features. After installing a Python interpreter, 
Python Markdown, Pygments, and the Python Imaging Library you should 
be ready to use Remark.

Installation
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

Remark was programmed using Python 2.6. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where ''x >= 6''. Note that the syntaxes of 
Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible.

The dependencies to other libraries are as follows:
 
 * [Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown] (Python, presumably newer versions also work)
 
 * [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML] (Javascript, we distribute this along Remark)
 
[PythonMarkdown]: http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/
[AsciiMathML]: http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/asciimath.html

After installing a Python interpreter and Markdown Python library you should
be ready to use Remark.

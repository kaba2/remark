Installation
============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

Remark was programmed using Python 2.7. Thus it should run in any
Python 2.x interpreter, where x is at least 7. Note that the syntaxes of 
Python 3.x and Python 2.x are not compatible.

Python dependencies
-------------------

The dependencies to other Python libraries are as follows:
 
### [Python Markdown 2.0][PythonMarkdown]

This library is used to convert Markdown to Html.
 
### [Pygments 1.5][Pygments]

This library is used to highlight source code. 
 
### [Python Imaging Library 1.1.7][PIL]

This library is used to create thumbnails for image galleries.

### [Python GTK][PyGtk]

A sub-library of PyGtk, called PyRsvg, is used to convert SVG
images to PNG. The PyRsvg in turn uses PyCairo to render the
svg image to a pixel-based image.

[Pygments]: http://pygments.org/

Javascript dependencies
-----------------------

The Javascript dependencies are on a per-page basis depending on 
which features the page uses. The dependencies to Javascript libraries 
are as follows.

### [Highslide][Highslide]

This library is used to view image galleries. 
We distribute it with Remark.
 
### [AsciiMathML][AsciiMathML]

This library is used to convert AsciiMath to MathML. 
We distribute it with Remark.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

First, make sure that you have the 32-bit Python installed (not 64-bit). 
The 64-bit version is problematic because it often happens that there 
is no installer for the 64-bit version of a Python library. In particular,
such installers are missing for the PyGtk and Python Markdown.
Naturally, you should then install all the Python libraries as 32-bit.

On Windows 7 (and other 64-bit Windows?), make sure that you run all 
the installers as an administrator (right click --> run as administrator). 
Otherwise, for example, the Python Markdown installer complains of not 
being able to add keys into the registry.

* Download and install Python from [here][Python_Installer].
* Download and install Python Markdown from [here][Markdown_Installer].
* Download and install Python Imaging Library from [here][PIL_Installer].
* Download and install Python Gtk using the _all-in-one_ installer from 
[here][PyGtk_Installer]. When running the installer, you must explicitly 
enable the installation of the pyrsvg library.
* Download and install SetupTools from [here][SetupTools_Installer].
This installs the `easy_install` tool used to install Pygments.

[Python_Installer]: http://www.python.org/download/
[Markdown_Installer]: http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Installation
[PIL_Installer]: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
[PyGtk_Installer]: http://pygtk.org/downloads.html
[SetupTools_Installer]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Open up the command-line, and type in:

	easy_install Pygments

This installs the Pygments library.

Summary
-------

After installing Python, Python Markdown, Python Imaging Library, 
Python Gtk, SetupTools, and Pygments, you should be ready to use 
Remark.

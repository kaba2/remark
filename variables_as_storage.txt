Variables as text storage
=========================

[[Parent]]: variables.txt

This page introduces the basic use of variables in Remark.
Here we view variables as a way to store and retrieve
text.

Defining variables
------------------

Variables can be defined and redefined as follows.

	[[set Gallery.thumb_min_length: 50]]

	[[set Gallery.thumb_min_length]]: 50

	[[set some_file_list]]:
		filename.txt
		another.txt
		
	[[set_many]]:
		Gallery.thumb_min_length 50
		Gallery.thumb_max_length 70
		
	[[set_many Gallery]]:
		thumb_min_length 55
		thumb_max_length 75
		
[[set Gallery.thumb_min_length: 50]]

[[set Gallery.thumb_min_length]]: 50

[[set some_file_list]]:
	filename.txt
	another.txt
	
[[set_many]]:
	Gallery.thumb_min_length 50
	Gallery.thumb_max_length 70
	
[[set_many Gallery]]:
	thumb_min_length 55
	thumb_max_length 75

Note that with `set_many` it is not possible to
assign multi-line parameters.

Retrieving a variable
---------------------

The text contained in a variable can be obtained
in this way:

	[[Gallery.thumb_min_length]]

	[[some_file_list]]
	
This simply expands into the stored text:

[[+Verbatim]]:
	[[Gallery.thumb_min_length]]
	
	[[some_file_list]]

### Alternative form

Alternatively one can use:

	[[get Gallery.thumb_min_length]]

	[[get some_file_list]]

However, we encourage using the first form
because it has less clutter.
	
Appending to a variable
-----------------------

Lines can be appended into a variable like this:

	[[add some_file_list]]:
		third_file.txt
		
[[add some_file_list]]:
	third_file.txt

After which invoking

	[[some_file_list]]
	
Yields:

[[+Verbatim]]:
	[[some_file_list]]

Variable scopes
---------------

Each variable lives in some scope which
defines its visibility and life-time. Each macro
invocation creates a child-scope into the current
scope. Variables defined inside the macro invocation
are placed into this scope. When a macro finishes, its scope
is closed and all the local variables in the scope are 
destroyed. When no macro invocations are active, the
only active scope is the _global scope_. Child scopes
can refer to variables in the parent scopes, but not
vice versa. When a variable that does not exist in the 
current scope is set, a new local variable is created.
Consider the following example:

	[[set word: world]]
	
	[[set my_macro]]:
	    [[set word: jello]]
		Hello [[word]]!

[[set word: world]]

[[set my_macro]]:
	[[set word: jello]]
	Hello [[word]]!

Then this:

	[[my_macro]]
	
	word = [[word]]

produces this:

[[my_macro]]

word = [[word]]

That is, the variable `word` inside `set my_macro` is introduced as a 
local variable and hence does not affect the variable `word` at the 
outer scope.

### Retrieving a variable in an outer scope 

The `get` command will look at outer scopes if a variable is not
found at the local scope. However, when there is _both_ a local variable 
and a variable of the same name in an outer scope, the latter can be 
retrieved with the `outer` command.    

Consider the following example:

	[[set word: world]]
	
	[[set my_macro]]:
		[[set word: jello]]
		Hello [[outer word]]!

[[set word: world]]

[[set my_macro]]:
	[[set word: jello]]
	Hello [[outer word]]!

Then this:

	[[my_macro]]
	
	word = [[word]]
	
produces this:

[[my_macro]]

word = [[word]]

### Setting a variable in an outer scope 

The `set` command always creates a local variable. You
can use the `set_outer` command to set an existing variable
at an outer scope. In case no such variable is found, a
new variable is created at the global scope. 
Consider the following example:

	[[set word: world]]
	
	[[set my_macro]]:
		[[set_outer word: jello]]
		Hello [[outer word]]!
	
[[set word: world]]

[[set my_macro]]:
	[[set_outer word: jello]]
	Hello [[outer word]]!

Then this:

	[[my_macro]]
	
	word = [[word]]
	
produces this:

[[my_macro]]

word = [[word]]

### Appending a variable in an outer scope.

The `add_outer` command works similarly to `set_outer`,
but instead of assigning, it appends text.

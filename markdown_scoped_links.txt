Markdown scoped links
=====================

[[Parent]]: markdown_syntax.txt

A _link-scope_ is a set of link-definitions. Every region and a list-item has its own link-scope. When a link is a defined in Remark, it is appended to the closest link-scope among its ancestor elements. Conversely, when a link is referenced, its definition is first searched from its closest link-scope, and on failure from ancestor link-scopes. 

Remark extends Markdown with scoped links.

History
-------

The [region extension][Region] extended Markdown with new kinds of blocks where it is very natural that link-definitions are encapsulated in them. Surprisingly, in April 2015, Python Markdown ignored link-definitions inside regions. The reason for this was simple: Python Markdown only supported link-definitions at the _global scope_. According to the maintainer of Python Markdown, this was also the behavior in other Markdown parsers. Since we were [unable to persuade the maintainer][BugReport] on the importance of scoped links, we wrote an extension ourselves.

Markdown scoped links
=====================

[[Parent]]: markdown_syntax.txt

A _link-scope_ is a set of link-definitions. When a link is a defined in Remark, it is appended to the closest link-scope among its ancestor elements. Conversely, when a link is referenced, its definition is first searched from its closest link-scope, and on failure from ancestor link-scopes. 

Remark extends Markdown with scoped links.

Elements with a link-scope
--------------------------

The following html-elements have their own link-scope.

`<div>`
: A block.

`<li>`
: A list-item.

`<td>`
: A table-item.

`<dd>`
: A definition.

History
-------

The [region extension][Region] extended Markdown with new kinds of blocks where it was natural for link-definitions to be embedded in them. Surprisingly, in April 2015, Python Markdown ignored link-definitions inside regions. This was because it only supported link-definitions at the _global scope_. According to the maintainer of Python Markdown, this was also the behavior in other Markdown parsers. Since he declared not wanting to implement scoped links, we wrote an extension ourselves.

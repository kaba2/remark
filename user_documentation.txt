User documentation
==================

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

This section gives you the necessary information to use Remark
(and a bit more). My suggestion is that you first read
_Concepts_, then go for _Remark syntax_. This order will get
you quickly started. The others contain a bit deeper information
which I however recommend to read at some point.

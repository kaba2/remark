### 23.01.2010: Released Remark 1.1.0

 * Feature: Added option parsing to console interface.
 
 * Feature: Non-converted files are now copied only if they match
 a filename-pattern specified at the command line (filesToCopy arguments).
 
 * Feature: Tag-parsers now only read at most 100 lines from a file
 (configurable via the option -l). This speeds up the parsing of
 tags.

### 13.01.2010: Released Remark 1.0.1

 * Bug-fix: some directories were written in Windows-style 
 backslashes into the html files depending on which OS was
 used to run Remark.

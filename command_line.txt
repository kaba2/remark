Command-line
============

[[Parent]]: user_documentation.txt

This section contains information on running Remark from the command-line.
Remark also contains an inbuilt help which can be invoked by running Remark
from the command-line without any arguments.

Usage
-----

From the command-line (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, ...): 

	remark.py inputDirectory outputDirectory (option|file-glob)*

### Linux and Mac OS X

The shells on Linux and Mac expand the globs (e.g `*.txt`) _before_
running an executable (unless the globs do not match anything in
the current directory). Therefore, the globs should always be 
provided in the form `"*.txt"`, to defer the glob-expansion from
the shell to Remark.

Options
-------

The command-line options control the way Remark operates. They are
as follows:

`-b` or `--bug`
:	Enables debug-reporting.

`-c` or `--config`
: 	Reads a JSON configuration file (if it exists). If the file path is relative, it is relative to the input directory. The file `remark_config.json` is always included as a config-file, if it exists.

`-d` or `--disable`
:	Disables a specific warning (e.g. `-dinvalid-input`).

`-e` or `--extensions`
:	Lists all file-extensions in the input-directory along with example files.

`-g` or `--generate-markdown`
:	Generates the Markdown-source for each file, before the conversion to html. This is useful for debugging Remark. The file-name of the Markdown-source is the file-name of the input file, with the file-extension replaced with `.md.txt`.

`-i` or `--include`
:	Includes files by their relative-paths (e.g. `"*.txt"`).
	This is equivalent to writing the file-glob directly as a 
	positional argument.

`-l` or `--lines`
:	Sets maximum number of lines for a tag-parser to scan a file
	for tags (default 200).

`-m` or `--max-file-size`
:	Sets maximum file-size to load (in bytes, default -1 to ignore).

`-o` or `--options`
:	Reads command-line options from an option-file (if it exists). An option-file is a plain-text file, with one option per line. If the file path is relative, it is relative to the input directory. The file `remark_options` is always included as an option-file, if it exists. This option is available for compatibility; use config files instead.

`-q` or `--quick`
:	Regenerates only modified documents and their parents. Note: only use for quick previews of edits; this process leaves many documents out-of-date.

`-r` or `--version`
:	Prints the version number.

`-s` or `--strict`
:	Treats warnings as errors.

`-u` or `--unknowns`
:	Lists all files which are neither included or excluded.

`-v` or `--verbose`
:	Prints additional progress information.

`-x` or `--exclude`
:	Excludes files by their relative-paths (e.g `"*CMake*"`). Exclusion takes priority over inclusion.

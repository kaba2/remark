====================

[[Parent]]: variables.txt

Remark predefines several variables. Those variables are listed here.

### Predefined variables

The following variables are predefined by Remark:

description
:	Description of the current document.

detail
:	Detailed description of the current document.

file_name
: 	The filename of the current document.

relative_name
:	Relative path to the current document from the
    input directory root. 

### Special variables

The following variables have a special meaning:

html_head
:	This text is appended to the head section of the html-page,
	after the text that is possibly appended by macros.

Examples

This:

	3. [[get relative_name]]

	4. [[get detail]]
	
produces this:

[[+Verbatim]]:
	1. [[get description]]
	
	2. [[get file_name]]

	3. [[get relative_name]]

	4. [[get detail]]
	
Note that Remark source files do not have a detailed description
and that is why nothing is output for it.

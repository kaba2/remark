### Versioning

The versioning of Remark is given in the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z 
are integers. The x increments only for major changes, the y increments 
for feature changes, and the z increments for bug fixes or documentation 
updates. Whenever y is incremented, z is zeroed, and whenever x is 
incremented, both y and z are zeroed. The x, y, and z need not consist 
of a single digit, and, for example, 1.12.0 is a much later version 
than 1.1.3.

Remark 1.2.0
------------

Release date 11.03.2010.

[Original webpage][Remark-1.2.0]

#### Core

 * Allowed free positioning of Remark macros. 
 * Added the ability to invoke macros via inline parameters.
 * Added explicit control over parameter and output
 expansion behavior in macro invocation.
 * Allowed local variables for macros.
 * Added `set_outer`, `add_outer`, and `outer` commands to 
 set, append, and retrieve variables at outer scopes, respectively.
 * Allowed parameter passing for variables to turn
 them into user-defined text transformations. 
 * Variables can now be retrieved simply by their name,
 rather than having to use `get`. 
 * Added `set_many` command to set variables easily.
 * Fixed a bug in `filesToCopy` pattern matching:
 a file was copied only if it matched all patterns.
  
#### Macros

 * Added FileLink macro to generate links with the link 
 description set to the filename of the target.
 * Added the implicit file searching algorithm for pure 
 filenames into various macros. 
 * DocChildren and Index macros now use 2 or 3 columns to 
 list the items if there are more than 7 of them.
 * Added Html macro to embed html directly.
 * Added Gallery macro to generate image galleries.
 * Added Verbatim macro to reinterpret text as
 verbatim content.
 * Added DirectoryLink macro to generate links to
 the containing directories of files.
 * Added Copy macro to copy the input without changes.
 * Added Ref macro to return the relative filenames of 
 the output documents.
 * Removed SkipExpansion macro. Its effect can
 be obtained with the Copy macro.

#### Interface

 * Added the option to merge a prologue file to the
 beginning of each document template.

#### Additional dependencies

 * Dependence to _Python Imaging Library_ via Gallery macro.
 * Optional dependence to _Highslide_ javascript library
 via Gallery macro.

Remark 1.1.0
------------

Release date 23.01.2010.

[Original webpage][Remark-1.1.0]

#### Core

 * Non-converted files are now copied only if they match
 a filename-pattern specified at the command line (filesToCopy arguments).
 * Tag-parsers now only read at most 100 lines from a file
 (configurable via the option -l). This speeds up the parsing of
 tags.

#### Interface

 * Added option-parsing to console interface.

 backslashes into the html files depending on which OS was
 used to run Remark.

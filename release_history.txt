Release history
===============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

This section summarizes the release history of Remark. Previous versions 
can be obtained through the given links.
The versioning of Remark is given in the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z 
are integers. The x increments only for major changes, the y increments 
for feature changes, and the z increments for bug fixes or documentation 
updates. Whenever y is incremented, z is zeroed, and whenever x is 
incremented, both y and z are zeroed. The x, y, and z need not consist 
of a single digit, and, for example, 1.12.0 is a much later version 
than 1.1.3.

Remark 1.5.0
------------

Release date 28.08.2012

[Original webpage][Remark-1.5.0]

### Core

* Made Remark to copy a file only when the target file does not
exist _or_ the source file has been modified after the target file.
* Fixed a crash when facing Unicode decode errors in tag parsers
and when generating such files. Replaced with a warning to pinpoint
the problematic file and continuing.
* Made Remark name links to code-files with their filenames, rather
than with their descriptions.
* Added document-tags.
* Escaped Markdown meta-characters in path-based link-descriptions
(e.g. \_\_init\_\_.py instead of __init__.py).
* Removed predefined variables, and replaced them with document tags.
* Removed get-command.

### Interface

* Added an option for verbose mode, and moved successful output
from the normal mode to the verbose mode. This makes it easier
* Added an option for incremental mode, which may give incorrect
results, but is fast for previewing changes.
to spot warnings and errors.
* Added an option for setting the maximum file size to load.
* Added timing for the generation process.
* Added a warning about a description missing for a document-group.
* Added a warning about using the relative form in links where the 
pure form would already be unambiguous. This enforces robust linking.

### Document types

* Generalized the concept of a document type not only to describe
the conversion by Remark syntax, but to completely abstract the
conversion process.
* Every document in the document tree now has a document type.
* Added the Copy document type, which simply copies the input file
to the output file. This is the default document type.

### Macros

* Added the ParentList macro to generate a list of parent documents.
* Added the DocumentTree macro to generate parts or all of the document tree.
* Added the Example macro to easily generate examples in Remark.
* Gallery: Increased the default number of pixels in thumbnails.
* Gallery: Made the macro work also with vector-based images, such
as .svg.
* Gallery: Added support for multiple image formats, so as to
generate thumbnails for .svg from a pixel-based alternative image.
* DocChildren and Index: Changed the listings to lists rather than 
tables for better CSS-styling. Added `class_name` variables.
* Renamed GenericCode macro to Code macro, and made GenericCode an 
alias of Code.

### Tag parsers

* Added the Dictionary_TagParser which uses a much more efficient
search algorithm than the previous Regex_TagParser (one regex for 
all tags, instead of one regex per each tag).
* Removed Empty_TagParser.
* Removed Regex_TagParser.

### Documentation

* Updated for better structure.
* Added installation instructions for 64-bit Windows's.
* Added the version number in the footer.

### Html and CSS

* Updated the CSS-style files.
* Made the generated html-boilerplate more standards-conforming.

### AsciiMathML

* Added support for online mimetex-rendering as a fallback when 
the browser does not support MathML.

### Highslide JS

* Upgraded to use Highslide JS 4.1.13.

Remark 1.3.0
------------

[Original webpage][Remark-1.3.0]

Remark 1.2.0
------------

Release date 11.03.2010.

[Original webpage][Remark-1.2.0]

#### Core

 * Allowed free positioning of Remark macros. 
 * Added the ability to invoke macros via inline parameters.
 * Added explicit control over parameter and output
 expansion behavior in macro invocation.
 * Allowed local variables for macros.
 * Added `set_outer`, `add_outer`, and `outer` commands to 
 set, append, and retrieve variables at outer scopes, respectively.
 * Allowed parameter passing for variables to turn
 them into user-defined text transformations. 
 * Variables can now be retrieved simply by their name,
 rather than having to use `get`. 
 * Added `set_many` command to set variables easily.
 * Fixed a bug in `filesToCopy` pattern matching:
 a file was copied only if it matched all patterns.
  
#### Macros

 * Added FileLink macro to generate links with the link 
 description set to the filename of the target.
 * Added the implicit file searching algorithm for pure 
 filenames into various macros. 
 * DocChildren and Index macros now use 2 or 3 columns to 
 list the items if there are more than 7 of them.
 * Added Html macro to embed html directly.

 * Added Verbatim macro to reinterpret text as
 verbatim content.
 * Added DirectoryLink macro to generate links to
 the containing directories of files.
 * Added Copy macro to copy the input without changes.
 * Added Ref macro to return the relative filenames of 
 the output documents.
 * Removed SkipExpansion macro. Its effect can
 be obtained with the Copy macro.

#### Interface

 * Added the option to merge a prologue file to the
 beginning of each document template.

#### Additional dependencies

 * Dependence to _Python Imaging Library_ via Gallery macro.
 * Optional dependence to _Highslide_ javascript library
 via Gallery macro.

Remark 1.1.0
------------

Release date 23.01.2010.

[Original webpage][Remark-1.1.0]

#### Core

 * Non-converted files are now copied only if they match
 a filename-pattern specified at the command line (filesToCopy arguments).
 * Tag-parsers now only read at most 100 lines from a file
 (configurable via the option -l). This speeds up the parsing of
 tags.

#### Interface

 * Added option-parsing to console interface.

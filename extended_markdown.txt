Extended Markdown syntax
========================

[[Parent]]: remark_syntax.txt

Remark uses the Python-Markdown library to convert Markdown
syntax to html. In addition to supporting the standard Markdown
syntax, it also supports useful syntactic extensions.
We have decided to enable some, but not all, of them.
Specifically, the extensions we have enabled are:
tables, abbreviations, and definition lists.
This section summarizes their use. A link to more information 
is given below. Some of the following examples have been copied 
from the Python-Markdown homepages.

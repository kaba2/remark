Remark syntax
=============

[[Parent]]: user_documentation.txt

Remark syntax is a slightly extended version of the Markdown
syntax. Therefore, if you can write Markdown, you can also
write much of Remark. To write Remark, you must be able to
write Markdown, AsciiMathML, and use the Remark macros.
In these pages we will give you just the basics of the former two,
and direct more advanced usage to dedicated tutorials. Remark 
syntax is quite simple and intuitive and shouldn't take you 
much time to get a good grasp on.

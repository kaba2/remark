Remark syntax
=============

[[Parent]]: remark.txt

Remark syntax is a slightly extended version of the Markdown
syntax. Therefore, if you can write Markdown, you can also
write much of Remark. We have decided to introduce
you only the basics of Markdown syntax here and redirect
you elsewhere for learning more advanced features of Markdown.
We will be giving more attention to the features 
Remark syntax adds on top of the Markdown syntax.
